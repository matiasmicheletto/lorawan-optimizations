GW Count: 60
ED Count: 25000
Exit conditions: 
 Timeout: 120 seconds.
 Stagnation limit: 1%

Step 1 -- Build clusters (reacheability tensor) -- elapsed = 0 sec.
No coverage for SF 7: ED 0 cannot be assigned to any GW.
No coverage for SF 8: ED 12 cannot be assigned to any GW.

Step 2 -- Find and allocate essential nodes -- elapsed = 114 sec.

Essential GWs: 0 (of 60):


Total connected nodes to essential GWs: 0 (25000 left).

Step 3 -- Sort nodes by reachable gateways -- elapsed = 210 sec.
Sorting finished.

Step 4 -- Allocation of non essential nodes -- elapsed = 211 sec.
Start allocation from SF 9

Time limit reached in allocation phase. Breaking phase.
